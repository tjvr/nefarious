Dev notes
=========

There are four kinds of object:

* Nodes -- generated by the parser

    Node, Literal, Call, INT_ADD, ...

* Types -- used in the parser, to define the CFG

    Int, Text, Var, Func, ...

* Values -- used in the language

    W_Int, W_Text, W_Var, W_List, W_Func, ...

* Names -- used to access Records, and also Frames.
