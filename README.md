_Nefarious Scheme_.
===================

A programming language with:

* **mutable syntax**.
* equivalence between types and CFG non-terminals.
* lexical scope.
* an incremental hybrid GC.
* ~~a fast tracing JIT-based interpreter (based on PyPy).~~ [not yet --compilers are hard.]

**_Work in progress._**
