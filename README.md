_Nefarious Scheme_.
===================

A programming language with:

* **mutable syntax**.
* function _syntax_ rather than function names.
* equivalence between types and CFG non-terminals.
* lexical scope.
* an incremental hybrid GC.
* ~~a fast tracing JIT bytecode VM (based on PyPy).~~ [not yetâ€”compilers are hard!]

**_Work in progress._**
